I have been keeping myself from pushing it to github because I want to clean the code and add documentation but I havent had any time for it after I got a working mqtt bridge.

I have been running this in production at home with about 10 bulbs for about 6 months so maybe someone else has use of it even if the code isn't pretty. 

The only problem I have notices is that the reconnection code some times doesnt work right after a bulb is restarted by disconnecting it's power, other than that I don't know about any issues.

When I get back to working on this the Go API and MQTT stuff might start changing....
